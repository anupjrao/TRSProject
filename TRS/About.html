    <div id="body"><p>Travel Reservation System is a web based application that enables the users to book tickets for travel purposes over a wide selection of options in terms of mode of transport. Users may book tickets over the three modes of transport, i.e Airways, Roadways and Railways.  It also enables the users to view and/or delete their reservations individually. This system has been implemented as an interactive one where users are given a graphical interface to select seats and view ones that have already been reserved. Users may reserve their seats based on dates and timings to their convenience. This application also includes CSS based page styling to give a visually pleasing aesthetic.
This project is based on an SQL Database with PHP being used to retrieve data from the back-end and display it on the front end designed using HTML, styled using CSS.</p></div>
